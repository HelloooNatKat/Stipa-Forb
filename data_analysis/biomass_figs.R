## Script Description: make biomass figures

## Script Notes: 
## statistical model has been moved to 'models.R' script! - CW 12/10
## if needed, any older versions of the code can be accessed on the github repo, but I think I have trimmed this down to the necessary basics and kept everything we might need - CW 12/10

#CHHAYA 
#I like the idea of grouping by native/non-native. Pretty sure it's Stipa now, not Nassella
#Biggest take-away: Stipa promotes growth of both native and non-native species

#FOR ME 
#Effect of precip varies compared to what background youâ€™re in (interactive effect). 
#Additive means there may be an effect of precip regardless of background, and there is an effect of background regardless of precip. 

## TWIL control C data missing - go look for this, seems like there should be some

# Set up ####
## clean env
rm(list=ls())

## load packages
library(lmerTest)
library(dplyr)
library(lme4)
library(MuMIn)
library(emmeans)
library(ggplot2)
library(car)
library(ggpubr)

## read in cleaned data
source("data_cleaning/calculate_RII.R")

## create standard error function
calcSE<-function(x){
  x2<-na.omit(x)
  sd(x2)/sqrt(length(x2))
}

## set theme for plots
theme_set(theme_classic())

# Figures ####
## Hypotheses ####
## writing here so we can try to focus the figs on these

## Hypothesis 1:
#Hypothesis (1a) native forb species will perform better in Stipa pulchra backgrounds than in Bromus hordeaceus backgrounds because of historical plant community relations. 

#Hypothesis (1b) non-native species will perform equally well in native and non-native backgrounds due to high seed output and survival rate. 

## Hypothesis 2: 
#Hypothesis (2a) drought will reduce biomass in all species, particularly in those growing in Bromus hordaceous backgrounds compared to Stipa pulchra. 
#Hypothesis (2b) native species may be less affected by drought conditions than non-native species due to local adaptations. 

## Biomass Figs ####
### species separate ####
## for this figure, I suggest showing only ambient rather than averaging across rainfall treatments

### overall pattern ####
## leaving this here for the moment, but I don't think we will use this figure, because averaging across the species biomass values is really heavily affected by changes in big species and won't really show changes from smaller species
#average<-all.bkgrd %>%
  #group_by(bkgrd, treatment) %>% 
 # summarize(mean_biomass=mean(total.biomass.rounded.percap, na.rm = TRUE), se_biomass=calcSE(total.biomass.rounded.percap)) %>%
 # mutate(bkgrd = ifelse(bkgrd == "BRHO", "Bromus", bkgrd))

#ggplot(average,aes(x=bkgrd, y=mean_biomass, color=treatment))+
 # geom_point(size=3)+ #size can be adjusted here!
 # geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean_biomass-se_biomass, ymax=mean_biomass+se_biomass), width = 0.25)+

  #ylab("Total Biomass Per Capita")+
 # xlab("Background")+
  #scale_color_manual(values = c("#008080", "#CA562C"), labels = c("Control", "Drought"))+
